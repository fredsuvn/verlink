# VerLink: A tool to create junction point links for multi-versioned software

## Overview

VerLink is a tool to create junction point links for multi-versioned software.
If a software has multiple versions, for example, the JDKs, it is often necessary to create junction point links to
switch between different JDK versions.
VerLink simplifies this process by providing a user-friendly interface to create these links.
